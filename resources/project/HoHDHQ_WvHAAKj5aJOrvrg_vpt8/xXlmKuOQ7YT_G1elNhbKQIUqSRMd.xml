<Info description="Preliminary_Operations is a Matlab Project with the programs required to setup for the program to build and fix the MODIS, Aqua L2 SST fields in us-west-2. There two programs&#xa;&#xa;1) rewrite_original_sst_file_nccopy.m - copies a subset of variables from files generated by the Ocean Biology Processing Group and served from https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi/browse.pl?sen=amod to a new netCDF file. Variables copied are: year, day, msec, slon, slat, clon, clat, elon,  elat, csol_z, sst, sstref, qual_sst, flags_sst and tilt. The most important of these is flags_sst, which is needed to fix the quality mask.  &#xa;&#xa;The name of the output file is the same as that of the input file with '_original.nc4' replacing '.nc' at the end of the OBPG file. &#xa;&#xa;This program must be run on all OBPG files and the results moved to S3 when ready to generate fixed orbits.&#xa;&#xa;2) get_nadir_info.m - This function reades the nadir lat, lon locations for all granules in a month and saves the information need to contruct full orbit files starting at descending 78 S.&#xa;&#xa;This program must be run prior to the program that reads all of the lats, lons, sst,... for an orbit and then fixes various problems." />
